# From Few to None: Exploring Few-Shot, One-Shot, and Zero-Shot Deep Learning in Clinical Settings

# IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHIâ€™23)


## Tutorial
Deep learning algorithms have made significant advances in a wide range of clinical applications, including medical imaging informatics, clinical natural language processing, and health data sciences. However, traditional deep learning methods often require large columns of manually annotated and gold-standard data, which can be expensive and very time-consuming in clinical settings. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing deep learning methods that can learn from a few samples or even no samples at all, known as few-shot and zero-shot learning, respectively. The current tutorial at IEEE BHI 2023 aims to mainly provide a professional forum to share state-of-the-art in few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot learning in two different settings: (1) Medical Imaging Informatics and Transcriptomics, and (2) Clinical Natural Language Processing. In this tutorial, which is also equipped with a hackathon, we will be exploring the latest advances in few-shot deep learning. We will start with an overview of the basic concepts and techniques involved in these areas, and we will then dive into specific applications of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot learning in medical imaging, image embeddings of molecular (RNA-Seq) data, and clinical natural language processing. Participants will have the opportunity to work on hands-on coding exercises and challenges, using popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. They will learn how to build, train, validate, and test few-shot models, and how to evaluate their performance on different datasets. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have a solid understanding of the state-of-the-art in few-shot deep learning and will achieve practical experience in implementing and validating these techniques.

### Dataset
<p align="justify">We will be using knee radiographs (X-rays) that are publicly available through the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/oai" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)</a>. You may want to create an account there and download knee/hip X-ray images. However, in this GitHub repository, we provide you with a sample subset of the images with manual  segmentation masks. During the tutorial, we will be mainly using this sample data.</p>
